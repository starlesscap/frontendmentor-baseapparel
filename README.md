## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS media query
- JS HTML DOM


### What I learned

This project helped to practice and incorporate the following CSS properties:
- z-index
- pseudoclasses of <input>
- linear gradient for background


### Continued development

- Form/input validation using Javascript
- Learn how to use CSS Grid


### Useful resources

- [MDN: Client-side Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This helped me to manipulate the error message that the browser displays when the form validation fails.
- [CSS Guides: A Complete Guide to CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped to learn CSS Flexbox.
